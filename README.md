# CODING-FOR-BIO
Here, you will find repositories on different tasks worked on during the Hackbio Coding for Bio Internship.

STAGE 0- Use of different data structures to arrange personal information of group members 

STAGE 1- Use of functions to perform various operations (Translation of DNA to Protein, Generation of Logistic Curve, Calculation of Hamming Distance).

STAGE 2- Biochemistry & Oncology
Proteins structures are known to be strongly connected to their functions. However, at the amino acid level, not all amino acids contribute to structure and function equally. Galardini and colleagues decided to investigate the impact of all possible individual, non synonymous nonsense mutations on the structure and function of protein.
The functional impact was computed as SIFT scores and the structural impact was calculated as FoldX Score (in kCal/mol).

Task:
Investigation of amino acid that has the most functional and structural impact.

Key Finding:
This analysis revealed that Cysteine (C) and Glycine (G) demonstrated the highest combined impact on protein structure. Cysteine showed the highest structural impact (FoldX score: 4.62 kCal/mol), while Tryptophan (W) and Tyrosine (Y) displayed the strongest functional impacts (SIFT scores: 0.00799 and 0.00899 respectively).

Conclusion: 
 The combination of high frequency(> 100) and high impact suggests these amino acids are crucial "hotspots" for protein stability and function.
