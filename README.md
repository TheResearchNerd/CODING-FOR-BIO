# CODING-FOR-BIO
Here, you will find repositories on different tasks worked on during the Hackbio Coding for Bio Internship.

**STAGE 0**
Use of different data structures to arrange personal information of group members 

**STAGE 1**
Use of functions to perform various operations (Translation of DNA to Protein, Generation of Logistic Curve, Calculation of Hamming Distance).

**STAGE 2- Biochemistry & Oncology**
Proteins structures are known to be strongly connected to their functions. However, at the amino acid level, not all amino acids contribute to structure and function equally. Galardini and colleagues decided to investigate the impact of all possible individual, non synonymous nonsense mutations on the structure and function of protein.
The functional impact was computed as SIFT scores and the structural impact was calculated as FoldX Score (in kCal/mol).

Task: Investigation of amino acid that has the most functional and structural impact.

**STAGE 3- Anatomy and Physiology [Cancer]**

**Tumor Classification and Subgroup Identification in Cancer Datasets Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Machine Learning Approach**

This analysis leverages diagnostic features including tumor radius, texture, and concavity, to distinguish benign (B) and malignant (M) tumors and employs machine-learning techniques to identify potential subclasses.
